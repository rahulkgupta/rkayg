>This is a repost from my tumblr blog. Thought it would be good to have my new blog begin with this post.

I was born in the United States, a country that has relatively great living conditions.

I was born in the Bay Area, a beautiful, sunny area that is full of diversity and really smart people.

I was born to an immigrant family that stressed hard work and humility.

I was born to a pair of parents who put their children's happiness above their own.

I was born to a family that stressed education and payed for tuition, knowing that education was key to their children's success.

I was born to a family where my mom spent her time taking care of my brother and I, forgoing her own career.

I was born to a relatively stable family in which family struggles remained minimal and were always resolved.

The reason I'm mentioning this is because I recently received a full time job straight out of college, a feat that is becoming harder to do nowadays.

I didn't receive the job because I'm an exceptionally smart or hard working person. I received it because I was born lucky.

Sure, I worked very hard, but I would argue that people working in minimum wage situations work just hard if not harder to barely scrape by.

Sure, I'm intelligent, but I was not born intelligent. My parents instilled in me an appreciation for knowledge and learning because they believed those to be the most important values to teach their children.

__I would not have gotten to where I am by myself.__
